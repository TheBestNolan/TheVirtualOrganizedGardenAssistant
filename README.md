#Overview

This program creates a virtual organized garden assistant, or V.O.G.A. 
V.O.G.A can help keep a garden organized by keeping track of the size of
a garden, the plants in a garden, and individual notes on the plants. V.O.G.A 
can find specific plants, generate maps of gardens, remove plants, etc.

#How to use

The code can be ran in most Java proggraming enviornments; howver, I used [JGrasp] (https://spider.eng.auburn.edu/user-cgi/grasp/grasp.pl?;dl=download_jgrasp.html).
Once running the code, V.O.G.A will tell the user how to use it.
Thank you for using V.O.G.A, I hope it is helpful
